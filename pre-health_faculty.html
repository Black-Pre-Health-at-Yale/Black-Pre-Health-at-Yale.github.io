       <img src="anjelicag.png" width="200" height="165" align="left"/>
       <p>Anjelica has a dedicated interest in training the next generation of scientists to think interdisciplinary and approach problems form a scientifically global perspective. With a multi-disciplinary approach, the Gonzalez lab combines organic chemistry, molecular biology, mathematics, computational modeling and image analysis to develop and use biomedically engineering scaffolds to dissect the chemo-mechanics of immunological processes. This work has special significance to an array of diseases and disorders, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and sepsis.</p>

      <div class="profile"><p><strong>Chima Ndumele, Health Policy & Management</strong></p>
      <img src="chima.jpg" width="150" height="180" align="left"/>
      <p>Chima Ndumele is an Associate Professor of Health Policy at the Yale School of Public Health and a Faculty Associate at the Institute for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University. He is also the co-director of the Yale Medicaid Policy Lab. Broadly, his research is focused on better understanding factors which influence the way vulnerable populations connect with and access health care resources. Specifically, he conducts work in three interconnected areas. The first examines how changes in public policy impact the care received by Medicaid enrollees. The second area explores how safety-net organizations, which serve a large proportion of traditionally disenfranchised groups, can improve health care services delivery. Finally, he investigates how the design and allocation of services in social policy programs (i.e. SNAP) influences patterns of care and health outcomes for low-income families. He received his PhD from the Brown University School of Public Health. </p>

      <div class="profile"><p><strong>Carolyn Roberts, History of Medicine</strong></p>
      <img src="carolynr.png" width="150" height="200" align="left"/>
      <p> Carolyn Roberts is an historian of medicine with a joint appointment in the departments of History/History of Science and Medicine and African American Studies.  Professor Roberts’ research interests concern early modern medicine where she explores themes of race and slavery, natural history and botany, and African indigenous knowledge in the Atlantic world. Professor Roberts is currently working on a book project called To Heal and To Harm: Medicine, Knowledge, and Power in the Atlantic Slave Trade.  This manuscript represents the first full-length study of the history of medicine in the British slave trade.  The book’s narrative is centered around the pharmaceutical and medical labor performed by a largely unknown group of African and British women and men, both enslaved and free.  In studying their labor, her project illustrates how the slave trade functioned as an insidious, and even ghostly, knowledge project which pushed the boundaries of pharmacy, surgery, and natural history.  Professor Roberts vividly traces how the slave trade contributed to the development of the pharmaceutical industry, the modernization of medicine, and the advancement of natural history. Professor Roberts is an award-winning educator who teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in the history of medicine from the sixteenth to the twenty-first centuries.  Her classes explore medicine, natural history, and epistemology in the context of early modern empires, slavery, the Atlantic slave trade, and in African American history more broadly.  Professor Roberts’ teaching also blends history with medical sociology in order to explore present-day crises of race and health. Professor Roberts received an M.A. and PhD from Harvard University, an M.A. from Andover Newton Theological School, and a B.A. from Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH.</p>
