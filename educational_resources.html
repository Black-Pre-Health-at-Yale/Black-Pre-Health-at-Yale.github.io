       <p>The link above will lead you to a collection of resources available on our campus and beyond.  These resources teach of the oppression of the black population and racism prevalent in medicine today.</p></div>

       <p>Malone Mukwende, a second year medical student at St. George's University of London, worked with faculty to put together a book that investigates clinical differences on black and brown skin.  He hopes this book will make health professionals aware of the necessity to understand how conditions are presented differently on black skin.</p></div>
